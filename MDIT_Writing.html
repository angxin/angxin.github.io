<p>In September 2023, I participated in the <a href="https://mdit2023.com/"><strong>Malaysia Data Innovation Talent (MDIT) Datathon</strong></a>. It is a national competition for university students hosted by <strong>Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM)</strong> and <strong>Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM)</strong>. The goal of the datathon is to use open-source government data to create a dashboard and present a solution to a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).</p>
<p>Our team, <strong>Lionhearts</strong>, consisted of me and my teammates, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chanhuiwen/">Chan Hui Wen</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ewen-lim-76b770191/">Ewen Lim Yuan-Khai</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jun-fei-ng-96b409253/">Ng Jun Fei</a> under the guidance of our lecturer <a href="https://www.nottingham.edu.my/Science-Engineering/People/gloria.teng">Dr Gloria Teng Ai Hui</a>. During the course of the datathon, we created a <strong>PowerBI dashboard</strong>, a <strong>comprehensive report</strong> and presented a <strong>live pitch</strong> to a panel of judges. Out of 100 teams that participated, I am proud to say our team earned <strong>3rd place</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="preliminary-round">Preliminary Round</h2>
<p>The competition officially started on 28th August 2023. We had to submit our dashboard and report within a week, so we quickly got started searching for data and choosing our topic. Our group chose to focus on <strong>air  pollution in Malaysia</strong> which covers <strong>SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being)</strong> and <strong>SDG 13 (Climate action)</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="final-round">Final Round</h2>
<p>We were one of the top ten groups invited to pitch at Bank Negara Malaysia and were given one week from the announcement to prepare for the presentation.</p>
<p>We were editing and re-editing the script and slides throughout the week to ensure all the important information was included within the 10 minutes allocated. We also had rehearsals among ourselves and under the supervision of Dr Gloria who gave us constructive feedback on our presentation.</p>
<p>Finally the day had come! Despite feeling nervous, I pushed on and presented with my team in front of the judges, who were data scientists from various agencies like Bank Negara Malaysia and DOSM.</p>

We got to watch amazing presentations from other groups and saw various approaches to their respective SDG problems.</p>
<p>In the end after all the weeks of hardwork, we successfully emerged with <strong>3rd place</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>The MDIT X DD 2023 was my first datathon experience and it allowed me to hone important skills I will need as a data scientist such as data scraping and report writing. Teamwork and presentation skills were also an important part in getting us towards our great results. I am grateful to my team and supervisor for putting so much effort into our project and performance. I also got the precious opportunity to meet data scientists from governmental agencies and hear their feedback on our project. Overall, it was an amazing experience and I hope to use my experience to complete even more impactful projects.</p>
